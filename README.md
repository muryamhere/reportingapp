# reportingapp
This repository contains a Reporting App with a three-layer security system. The app checks for a key in the local database, prompts the user if not found, and stores it. It constructs a URL with the key, retrieves credentials from the response, and logs into an Oracle database to display the app title. Secure and efficient!
